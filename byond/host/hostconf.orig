/*
Host Configuration File

Uncomment any of the following settings (ie remove //) and fill in the
appropriate values for your site.  If you do not change anything here, almost
everything will still work.  Some extra features such as email notification of
log file output will be dissabled.

Note that this file may also be edited through a web-style interface via the
root.dmb administrative tool.  If you do that, it will overwrite this file,
stripping out all of these comments.

/* You should register your host site as You.Host.X where X is whatever name
you choose for your server.  Fill in the full hub path below.  This is
necessary in order to send email notification of log file output to users.
Obviously, the login URL listed for the hub entry must point to this server.
The users of your host service must also be subscribed to You.Host.X (and so
should you) or have you listed as a friend. */

//hub = "Dantom.Host.Planet.Polaris"


/* The default host port is 1025, but this can be changed to whatever you
like.  If you do not specify a machine name, players who connect to games will
be rerouted to the game using the numerical IP address of your machine, rather
than its name.  This can cause routing problems for users in some cases.  Fill
in the full Internet address of the host to avoid that problem. */

//address = "byond.com:1025"


/* Each world that the host server spawns off must have its own network port
to accept user connections.  (This applies to the admin tools as well.)  If
you are behind a firewall, the firewall would need to be configured to allow
connections in through designated ports that you specify in the following
list.  The sample numbers are just to demonstrate the syntax: a list of
numbers or ranges.*/

//ports = "6000-6010,6015,6017"

/* Worlds which fail to startup after the specified amount of time will be
aborted.  The purpose of this is to avoid waiting indefinitely should
something go wrong, such as a crash of DreamDaemon during boot-up.  The
default timeout is 5 minutes. */

//startup_timeout = 5  //minutes

/* Setting suid = 1 enables setting the user id to the owner of the file when
running hosted worlds.  This is only supported by the UNIX operating system
and the host server must be run as root.  You would also usually want to turn
on trusted mode when enabling suid execution. */

//suid = 1

/* Setting trusted = 1 makes hosted worlds run in trusted mode rather than
safe mode.  Since this provides full access by the hosted worlds to the
computer, this should generally only be done in UNIX when using suid
execution, because then the operating system enforces filesystem security
based on the user id of the process. */

//trusted = 1


/* The following is an example of how to enter the values for an individual
site.  You do not even have to create an entry here at all, as long as you
create the user's site directory (described below). */

//home
//   jamesbyond
//      owner = "James Byond"
//      lock  = null   //("locked" or "frozen")
//      safe  = 1      //overrides the main -trusted execution mode


/*In addition to that, all sites must also have an entry in the host/home
directory.  This entry should be named with the ckey of the primary site
owner.  It can either be a real directory or (in UNIX) a symbolic link to
somewhere else, such as the user's actual home directory.  You can just copy
in the contents of the shared directory to create the initial contents of a
site.  In addition to that you would need to create a file cfg/admin.txt in
the site's top directory (same level as the byond directory).  Put the line
"JamesByond role=owner" in this file (no quotes), substituting the BYOND Key
of the true owner for JamesByond.

If you are running in -suid and -trusted mode (UNIX only), then create
~user/.byond/cfg/admin.txt instead of ~user/cfg/admin.txt, because you want to
make these user configurations instead of application-level settings.  The
root.dmb app does all this for you, so if this all sounds a bit overwhelming,
just connect to your host and let it do the work for you.
